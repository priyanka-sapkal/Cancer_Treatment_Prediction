# AI and Health Informatics Project

## Proposal:
Cancer Treatment Prediction on clinical and genomic data.

NN_Codes has dataset and code for all models.

## Dataset:
* ```NN_Codes/FinalCancer_Data.csv```

## Instructions:
* ```cd NN_Codes```
* To test k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier, and Decision Tree models from command line: ```python kNN.py```, ```python RF.py```, ```python DT.py```.
* To run with 10-Fold CV, uncomment lines in each of the above files.
* To test Neural Networks: ```python NN.py```.
* To run NN with 7-Fold CV: ```python SimpleNN.py```.
